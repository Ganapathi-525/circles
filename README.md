# circles

Write a code using React to create a circle of random radius within the closed interval [20px, 200px] with the center at the coordinates wherever the user clicks on the viewport. Additionally, there should be utmost 2 circles on the screen. When this limit is exceeded, all circles should vanish. Furthermore, youâ€™ll get bonus points for determining if the circles are intersecting and based on that changing the background color of the viewport.
